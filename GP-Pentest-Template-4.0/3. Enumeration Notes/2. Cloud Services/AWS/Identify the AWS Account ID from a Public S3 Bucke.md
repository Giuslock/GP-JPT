# Aws s3 account search

`python3 -m pip install s3-account-search` to install the tool `s3-account-search`. 
  
Example
```
s3-account-search arn:aws:iam::427648302155:role/LeakyBucket mega-big-tech
```

To find the S3 bucket region we can use another trick, this time with cURL.


```
curl -I https://mega-big-tech.s3.amazonaws.com
```

In the response headers we see that the header `x-amz-bucket-region` is set to `us-east-1`, which is North Virginia. Next, log into the AWS management console in your own personal AWS account and make sure that the `us-east-1` region is selected.
