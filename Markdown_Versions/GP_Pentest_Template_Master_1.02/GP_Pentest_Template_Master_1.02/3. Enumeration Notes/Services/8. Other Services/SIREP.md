# Sirep Test Service
The Sirep Test Service is a built-in service on Windows IoT Core devices that allows users to perform tests on hardware and drivers. It serves the Sirep/WPCon protocol, which exposes a remote command interface for attackers, enabling them to gain control over the device.

## Exploitation

The Sirep Test Service has been exploited in the past to gain remote access to Windows IoT Core devices. Attackers can use this service to run commands on the device, gain control over it, and even execute arbitrary code as SYSTEM.
